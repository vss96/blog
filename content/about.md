Hi there! :wave: I'm Vikas Shetty (_you can call me Vss_).

I work as a Software Developer @  [sahaj.ai][sahaj] where I help clients solve a variety of Engineering and ML problems. My area of interests include but not limited to Mathematics, Distributed systems, Computer Vision and Rust.

Besides programming, I'm also an amateur Technical Writer. My [blog](../blog/)
is one source where you can find most of my up-to-date written content. 

But when I'm not on the Terminal, you can find me on Steam
probably playing a game or two. If you would like to join me in a game, feel
free to drop a message. You can DM me on Discord(**KkonaLord#5243**).

- Twitter: [@vikas_sshetty][twitter]

**Note**: I'm more active on Twitter, so you'll definitely want to DM me there.
