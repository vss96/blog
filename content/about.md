Hi there! :wave: I'm Vikas Shetty (_you can call me Vss_).

I work as a Senior Software Engineer @ [Teya][teya] where I'm part of the **Teya Business Account** teamâ€”helping merchants spend their money smarter and smoother.
 My area of interests include but are not limited to Mathematics, Distributed Systems, Computer Vision, and Rust.

Besides programming, I'm also an amateur Technical Writer. My [blog](../blog/)
is one source where you can find most of my up-to-date written content.

But when I'm not on the Terminal, you can find me on Steam
probably playing a game or two. If you would like to join me in a game, feel
free to drop a message. You can DM me on Discord (**kkonalord**).
