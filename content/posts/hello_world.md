Finally figured out how to make this bad boy work! I have blogged before using other 3rd party providers like Wordpress but this is the first time I used Hugo. There was a little bit of trouble when I tried to bring the site online on Netlify (the hosting service). This blog's source code was forked but the repo did not have certain things required to make it work on Netlify, so it took some time and effort to figure that out. Regardless I'm glad that it's up and running. Hopefully I'll be able to post more content on random topics moving forward. 

See ya soon!
